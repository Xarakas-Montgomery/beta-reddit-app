    description: `Istanbul surprised me a lot! I would never imagined to be so fascinated by this city. 
                  We have been welcomed with courtesy by its citizens, yes a lot were throwing bad looks at my females' 
                  guests cause they were wearing showy clothes cause of their culture but it has been an amzing experience! 
                  
                  The food is amazing, fish is even fresher than ours and the view from our Hotel was stunning! Shame we have been there 
                  only for 4 days, the rest of our holidays we have been in Antalya but that will deserve another post! 
                  I really suggest to all my viewers to visit this country, especially the mosques. 
                  
                  The cherry on the cake is when at certain times, from the closest mosques, they were broadcasting from the speakers 
                  their prayers and this backsound was letting me realise that I'm not in Europe, indeed I was in another world and it was fascinating.
                  I felt somehow very thirsty in the middle of the desert, I dont know how to explain, but it felt good.
                  
                  Don't let you escape this WONDER! 
                  P.S. Istanbul has been voted and quoted to be at the top of the most beautiful cities IN THE WORLD!`,
